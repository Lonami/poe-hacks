poe-hacks syntax
================

the syntax for the .key files used by the rust version is not formally defined
anywhere, so you will need to read the parsing code to understand what is
currently possible. however, here's a breakdown of what's possible (this may
be out of date).

syntax
------

a .key file is made up of several rules.
each rule has its own line.
empty lines or lines starting with "//" are ignored (comments).

there are several keywords which you can use in every line:
* on. this will begin to define a precondition (what must happen for this rule to execute).
* do. this will begin to define a postcondition (what will happen when the precondition is met).
* toggle. this behaves like "do", but it will toggle the action on to keep running until it's toggled off.
* every. this will add a delay to a rule (meaning it will wait for some time before executing again).
* after. this will add a windup time to a rule (meaning it will wait for some time before actually executing it).
  you can also write an extra precondition instead, which must be true before "on" is checked.
* silent. this will make the action not show (if it's too spammy).

after a keyword, you have to configure the specifics.

the preconditions for "on" are as follows:
* life. the action will trigger after the life falls below the given threshold.
* mana. the action will trigger after the mana falls below the given threshold.
* es. the action will trigger after the energy shield falls below the given threshold.
* flask, key, skill. the action will trigger after a flask, or key, or skill button is pressed (these are all synonyms).
* wheel. the action will trigger when the mouse wheel is scrolled up or down.
* town. the action will trigger while you are in town.
* map. the action will trigger while you are in a non-town area.
* chat. the action will trigger when chat is "open" or "closed".

the life, mana and es values can be given as a flat number (like 500) or a percentage (30%).

the flask, key or skill expect a key to be pressed.
numbers (like 3) and letters (like W) can be typed directly.
you can also trigger on right mouse click by using 0x02
(you can find these values in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).

the wheel expect either "up" or "down" for the scroll direction.

you can use multiple "on" preconditions in the same rule,
so for example, you only get kicked if both your life and energy are low.

the postcondition for "do" are as follows:
* disconnect. the connection will be forcibly closed (this is why poe-hacks must run as admin).
  depending on your network this may take a while to actually kick you from the game.
* flask, key, skill. presses the given key.
* type. presses enter, types a message (like /hideout), and presses enter again.
* price. presses ctrl+c and pricechecks the item on trade.
* invite. presses ctrl+enter and uses /invite on the last whisper.
* destroy. left-clicks to select an item, presses enter, types /destroy, and presses enter again.
* downscale. enables downscaling (currently not working).
* upscale. disables downscaling (currently not working).
* disable. disables rules which press keys ("turns off" the program).
* enable. enables rules which press keys ("turns on" the program).

the duration for "every" is always a number ended in "ms" (for milliseconds).
there is a default duration of 500ms to avoid spamming actions on accident,
but a lower cooldown can be used if specified manually (such as 250ms).
you can also end the number in "s" (for seconds, which only works for whole numbers).

the duration for "after" follows the same rules as "every".
the default windup time is 0ms (so the action is executed instantly),
but a higher value can be used if timing is important (such as activating a flask and then a skill).

examples
--------

here are some rules you can directly copy into a .key file and have working:

// manual
on key Z do disconnect

// saving your life
on es 20% do flask 4 every 8s
on life 70% do flask 1 every 1500ms
on life 40% on es 20% do disconnect
on mana 30 do flask 5 every 6000ms

// qol
on key 0x11 on wheel up do click left every 5ms silent
on key 0x06 toggle click left every 150ms silent
on key W do flask 3 every 8000ms
on key W do key R every 8000ms after 500ms
on key F4 do invite
on key F5 do type /hideout
on key F6 do destroy

// press flasks after entering a map on leftclick
on map on key 0x01 after transition do flask 2 every 0

// disable keys on opening chat or entering town, enable them on closing chat or entering a map
on chat open do disable every 0 silent
on chat closed do enable every 0 silent
on town do disable every 0 silent
on map do enable every 0 silent

tips
----

you're advised to "open with" the .key file with the poe-hacks executable so
that you can double-click to launch poe-hacks using that file in easily.
