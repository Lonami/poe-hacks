poe-hacks
=========

just a few "hacks" written for pathofexile.

originally written in c++, then moved to python with a gui because
the config file was too hard, then rewritten into rust because fun
and power (and python machine broke).

despite the real use, the code in utils/input/make may be helpful
for others if you want to know:

* query and emulate mouse and keyboard input
* compile stuff with clang in windows
* force the executable to be ran as admin

if my code is bad, please send a pull request to make it less bad.

pathofexile.com is a fun game to play in hardcore, but dying is tough, so this
code just aids setting a key you can use to fast disconnect when in trouble...
